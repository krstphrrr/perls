                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Site</span>: a physical research location, the property of which is owned by one or more landowners. Sites may be participants of one or more research programs or networks.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Landowner</span>: an individual, institution, company or agency which owns land.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Network</span>: a group of sites that collaborate to meet one or more research goals. Click <a href="browse_sites.php">here</a> to see the list of networks.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Program</span>: a program of research, usually sponsored by an academic, non-profit or governmental institution. The research is generally done on one or more sites. The program does not necessarily own the land where the program conducts its research. Click <a href="#">here</a> to see the list of programs.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Gradient</span>: a collection of sites and/or programs that do research along an ecological gradient within a defined region. Ecological gradients can include regions where a factor such as elevation, precipitation, temperature, etc. graduates incrementally from low to high.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Ecosystem</span>: A community of organisms and their physical surroundings that constitute a unit. Here, we use generalized definitions that are common in the literature, such as temperate forest, Arctic tundra, etc.</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Region</span>: A broad region selected arbitrarily to help users locate sites. For example, the continental United States into three large regions – west, central and east.</p>

                <p>While you don't need to create an account to use the P2ERLS website, having an account has two benefits – it will allow you to <a href="#">save your searches</a> and possibly <a href="#">become an administrator</a> of the site (in order to add or modify site, program, and/or network information).</p>
                <p>To create an account, click on My Account and follow the directions provided. You will need to provide your name, email, and institution (if applicable), and supply a username and password. Click submit. An email will be sent to the email address you provided, with a link. Go to your email account to fetch the email, and click on the link. This will confirm your account.</p>

              <div><a name="save"></a><span class="section">Save Searches</span>
                <p>In order to save your searches, you will first need to <a href="#">create an account</a> or <a href="#">login</a> if you are an existing member. Once you are logged in, go to the Browse Sites page, and perform a search. Once you have the desired results of a particular search, click on the Save Current Search button. You will be prompted to enter a name. You may use any combination of letters, words and symbols except for the ampersand (&amp;). If you use an ampersand, the text following the ampersand will not appear in your saved search list. Once you have typed in the name of your search, click A message saying "[search name] has been saved" should appear. To find your searches later, just click on the Saved Searches link at the top of the page. You will see a list of your searches on the left-hand side of the page.</p>

                <p>We welcome input from the scientific community. If you would like to add a new site, program, or network to the P2ERLS system, we encourage you to do so directly, by applying to become an administrator of the P2ERLS database. Here's the process.</p>
                <p>First, you'll need to <a href="#">create an account</a> or <a href="#">login</a>. Once you are logged in, you will see a new Become An Administrator link at the top of the page. Click this link and follow the directions on the page that appears. When you apply to become an administrator of the website, you will be asked to agree to the following statement:</p>
                <p>"By requesting to become an administrator, I agree to add or modify sites only with the most up-to-date, correct information. Creation of non-existent entities or incorrect modification to existing entities will lead to the removal of my account from the P2ERLS system and any erroneous data that I have submitted."</p>
                <p>Once you have filled out and submitted the required information, the website administrator will need to review your submission and decide whether or not to authorize limited administrator privileges. This decision will be based on the accuracy of the information you have provided. Upon approval, an email will be sent to the email address you provided. Please note: the website administrator has the right to deny or revoke administrator privileges at any time.</p>
